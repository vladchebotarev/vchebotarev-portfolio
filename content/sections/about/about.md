I'am a Full Stack Developer, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I started building my first websites and got more and more interested in the web development.

After school, I started to study **Computer Science as a bachelor's degree** at the Cracow University of Technology. 

I have a serious passion for Web3 and Blockchain Technologies, frontend development and cloud solutions.

Well-organised person, problem solver, independent employee with high attention to detail. Fan of outdoor activities, TV series and home renovation.

Interested in the entire frontend spectrum and working on ambitious projects with positive people.
