I grew up amid a digital boom. As a teenager, I started building my first websites using HTML and CSS and became increasingly interested in web development.

After school, I started studying computer science at the Cracow University of Technology. During my studies, I started working as a junior C++ developer at Ericsson Corporation. After that, I started working as a web developer.

I started by learning modern web technologies from Laravel (PHP) and Vue.js. In 2018, I began to delve more into Node.js and React. In parallel, I studied cloud platforms, especially Amazon Web Services.

Recently, I have been seriously interested in Web3 and Blockchain technologies. I devote much time to studying the Solidity language, as I see great potential in this.

I can describe myself as a well-organized person with good problem-solving skills and an independent worker with great attention to detail.
